PREREQUISITES
=============
Before running m0util we need to create index using following m0clovis command

For example,

$ m0clovis -l 172.16.2.132@tcp:12345:44:301 \
	 -h 172.16.2.132@tcp:12345:45:1 \
	 -p '0x7000000000000001:1' \
	 -f '0x7200000000000000:0'\
	 index create "<0x780000000000000b:1>"

please refer to m0clovis usage for further details.


M0UTIL
======
m0util is a utility which is used to perform a variety of operations on mero. This
utility can perform I/O operations like async write and KV operations like set, put
and list key values from mero. In the future, it can be extended to support other operations
as well.

m0util reads mero configuration from file "conf" located in the same folder.
This is how conf file looks like

$ cat conf
#local address
172.16.2.130@tcp:12345:44:301

#ha address
172.16.2.130@tcp:12345:45:1

#profile id
<0x7000000000000001:0>

#process id
<0x7200000000000000:0>

#kvs_fid
<0x780000000000000b:1>

As of now, m0util takes the operation commands from an input file, which is given as a command line
parameter to the m0util command.

Following are the guidelines for the operation commands

1. Async write -

   m0write src_file idh idl block_count

2. KV Set -

   m0kvs_set key value

3. KV Get -

   m0kvs_get key

4. KV List -

   m0kvs_set key
